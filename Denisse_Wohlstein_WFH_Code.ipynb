At the time of the experiment the company was worth **$5** billion and it was the largest travel agency in China\n","\n","\n","#### **Does WFH work and how to assess that?**\n","\n","- Real estate prices were increasing significantly in Shanghai, so managers at Ctrip decided to consider the idea of allowing the employees from the call center in Shanghai to work from home\n","\n","- Managers at Ctrip wanted to achieve two things with the WFH policy: Reduce office rental costs and reduce the high attrition rates the firm was experiencing. However, they were concerned about the level of productivity and efficacy of the employees in the WFH setting.\n","\n","- Given all that, senior management decided to run a **randomized controlled trial**. The trial would run for 9 months.\n","\n","- Who participates? They asked the 998 employees in the airfare and hotel call centers departments of the Shanghai call center **whether they would be interested in working from home four days a week, with the fifth one in the office**. Approximately half of the employees (503) were interested, particularly those who had less education and tenure, their own room, and longer commutes. Out of the 503 employees interested, only 249 were qualified to participate in the experiment by virtue of having a long enough tenure (6 months or more), broadband access, and a private room at home where they could work.\n","\n","- After a lottery draw, those with even-numbered birthday were assigned to work from home, and those with odd-numbered birthdays stayed in the office acting as the control group. All tasks and working hours remained the same for both the control and treatment group, the only location between the two groups was the work location.\n","\n","#### **About the Experiment**\n","\n","- There were four jobs (hotel and airline) involved in the experiment:\n","\n","    1. Order Takers: anwser customer calls, took orders and entered them in the system.\n","    2. Order Placers: Dealt with the airlines and hotels and notified the clients\n","    3. Order Correctors: who resolved problems such as a flight being canceled\n","    4. Night Shift: that both placed and corrected orders\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","#### **Results**\n","\n","- The performance of the home workers went up dramatically, increasing 13% over the 9 months of the experiment. This improvement came mainly from a 9% increase in the number of minutes they worked during their shifts (the time they were logged in to take calls). The remaining 4% came from the increased number of calls per minute worked.\n","\n","- Attrition fell sharply among the WFH employees, dropping by 50% versus the control group\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bpu_knUPs5Y7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# *Importing the

The regressions are all probits at the individual level of the decision to work from home. Marginal effects calculated at the mean are reported. The total sample covers all Ctrip employees in their Shanghai airfare and hotel departments. Willingness to participate was based on the initial survey in November 2010. Employees were not told the eligibility rules in advance of the survey (own room, 6+ months tenure, broadband Internet connect). Robust standard errors are reported. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance, * 10% significance The pseudo R-squared for the table rises from 0.0042 in column (1) to 0.033 in column (7), highlighting how most volunteering to WFH was unpredicted by demographic characteristics.\n","aThe coefficients and standard errors have both been multiplied by 100 for scaling purposes.*\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_6rApW0duQlL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["summary_volunteer_df\n","#tenure: how many months has the person been in the company\n","#commute: in minutes

Why does Ctrip choose 4 days a week from home and one in the office?**\n","⏰\n","\n","**2. Why are we using a probit regression instead of a liner one?**\n","Probit regression model is utilized when the dependent variable can only take binary values (volunteer or not volunteer, 0 or 1).\n","\n","**- What does the summary of the table of the probit_results mean?**\n","Each coefficient represents the estimated change in the probability of the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding other variables constant.\n","*One unit increase in children will augment the probablity of volunteering % to wfh.*\n","\n","**3. What are the marginal effects of the mean and why do we need to compute them?**\n","\n","Marginal effects represent the change in the probability of the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable, taking into account the ***nonlinearity*** of the probit model.\n","\n","Calculating the marginal effect at the mean is a common practice because it provides an estimate of the average effect of the predictor variable across the sample. This means that the marginal effect represents the change in the probability of volunteering associated with a one-unit change in the number of children, holding other variables at their mean values.\n","\n","Coefficients from Probit Regression Results: The coefficients from the probit regression represent the estimated effect of each predictor variable on the latent variable (i.e., the linear combination of predictors) in the probit model. These coefficients are on the scale of the linear predictor and indicate the change in the z-score of the latent variable associated with a one-unit change in the predictor, assuming all other variables are held constant. In your example, the coefficient for \"children\" is 0.3140, indicating the change in the latent variable's z-score associated with a one-unit change in the number of children.\n","\n","Marginal Effects (dy/dx) from Marginal Effect Table: The marginal effects represent the change in the probability of the dependent variable (volunteering) associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable. Unlike the coefficients from the probit regression, which are on the scale of the latent variable, marginal effects are on the scale of the probability. They provide a more directly interpretable measure of the impact of each predictor on the probability of the outcome. In your example, the marginal effect of \"children\" is 0.1253, indicating the change in the probability of volunteering associated with a one-unit change in the number of children.\n","\n","So, while the coefficient from the probit regression tells you about the change in the latent variable, the marginal effect tells you about the change in the probability of the outcome variable.
